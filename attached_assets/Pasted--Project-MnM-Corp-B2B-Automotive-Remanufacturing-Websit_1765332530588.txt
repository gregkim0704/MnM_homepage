## 4. Implementation Steps
1.  **Setup:** Initialize Vite project, install Tailwind, Framer Motion, Lucide, React Router.
2.  **Data Structure:** Create `constants.ts` to store company history, product lists, and equipment details extracted from the PPT.
3.  **Components:** Build responsive Header (Navbar) and the **Mandatory Footer**.
4.  **Pages Development:**
    * Build Home with Hero and Stats.
    * Build Business page with Grid layout for products.
    * Build Technology page with a Step-by-Step process visualization.
5.  **Integration:** Assemble pages into `App.tsx` with routing.
6.  **Refinement:** Apply hover effects, ensure mobile responsiveness, and verify the specific Footer info.
